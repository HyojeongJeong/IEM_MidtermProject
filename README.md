We use the function that works like Bernoulli naive bayes to classify the mnist dataset.
The function inlcudes for loops and np.dots, np.log, and etc.
The result have about 70% accuracy, and it can be changed if the random state is changed.
Also, to get the higher accuracy, we need more developed implementation.
